This repository contains the Backend API of the Personal Health Train (PHT).
It communicates with some services of the PHT and need therefore to be configured properly, like described 
in the following sections.

## Installation
This package requires docker to be installed on the host machine.

```
PORT=<port>
NODE_ENV=<development|production>

API_URL=http://localhost:<port>/

WEB_APP_URL=http://localhost:<ui port>/

VAULT_CONNECTION_STRING=<token>@<api url>
RABBITMQ_CONNECTION_STRING=amqp://<username>:<password>@<host>
HARBOR_CONNECTION_STRING=<user>:<password>@<api url>

```

```
